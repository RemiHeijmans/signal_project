most of the test run. i can't figure out why some don't. Troughout this project i strugled a lot with the test. they always gave weird different problems.
but now it is better.
 I added all the facinating design patterns.
I learned a lot because of this week's task.Sadly, I am not 100% because of the tests.
I seriously hope that my weird test situation doesn't ruin my grade too much because I really did my best in this project. :)
