The test do not acctualy run again.
Because of the same issue as before.but either way, I added all the facinating design patterns.
I learned a lot because of this week's task.Sadly, I am not 100% because of the tests.
I kept the tests in the Alerts folder for simplicity because they won't run either way
I tried to fix it again, but there is something else wrong now. And sadly, I don't have enough time to fix it.

I seriously hope that my weird test situation doesn't ruin my grade too much because I really did my best in this project. :)
