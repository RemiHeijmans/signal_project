i made the changes like required. but i am not able to run the tests. there is somthing weird going on with maven. I have tried a lot of things but with no succes.
this also caused that i am not able to make a code coverage report eventho i tried to.
 inlcuded a test for every vital where the value is lowwer then it is supposed to be and higher then normal.
and a test if the storage system works.
i still included the tests screenshots eventho they failed.
